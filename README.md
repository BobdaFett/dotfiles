# Dotfiles!

This is my personal collection of dotfiles, which can be cloned into `~/.config` on any Linux machine to apply the configurations.

I included a submodule to my dotfiles-nvim repository, since I occasionally must use Windows instead of a Linux machine. This makes it
easier to clone the configs in this (rare) case.
